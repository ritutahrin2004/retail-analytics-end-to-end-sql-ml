# Customer Dimension (`dim_customer`)

## Objective
Create a minimal and stable customer dimension to support customer-level analysis
and downstream aggregation from international sales data.

This dimension standardizes customer identifiers and provides a consistent reference
for joining with sales fact tables.

---

## Source Table
- `fact_sales_international`

The customer dimension is derived exclusively from validated international sales data.

---

## Grain
**One row per unique customer**

Each record represents a distinct customer name observed in international sales transactions.

---

## Design Scope
This dimension is intentionally kept minimal to avoid over-modeling.

Included:
- Standardized customer identifier
- Surrogate customer key

Excluded:
- Address or geographic attributes
- Demographic assumptions
- Channel-specific attributes

These may be introduced later if reliable data becomes available.

---

## Data Transformation Process

### 1. Staging Table (`stg_customer`)
Customer names were extracted and standardized before creating the final dimension.

Transformations applied:
- Trimmed whitespace
- Converted customer names to uppercase
- Removed null or empty values
- Deduplicated customer records

---

### 2. Customer Dimension (`dim_customer`)
The final customer dimension was created from the staging table using a surrogate key.

---

## Output Tables
- `finance.stg_customer`
- `finance.dim_customer`

---

## Dimension Table Schema
`finance.dim_customer`

Columns:
- `customer_id` — surrogate primary key
- `customer_name` — standardized customer name

---

## Data Validation
- Verified uniqueness of customer names
- Confirmed non-null customer values
- Validated row counts against distinct customers in the fact table

---

## Usage
This dimension is used to:
- Support customer-level aggregations
- Join with `fact_sales_international`
- Enable future customer analytics and segmentation
- Serve as a foundation for extending customer data when additional sources are introduced

---

## Notes
The customer dimension was rebuilt after re-importing raw data and recreating fact tables.
This documentation reflects the final, validated structure derived from international sales data.

---

## Status
**Final and stable**
