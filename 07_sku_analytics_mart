# SKU Analytics Mart (`sku_analytics_mart`)

## Objective
Provide a consolidated, SKU-level analytical dataset combining product attributes
and aggregated sales performance across international and Amazon channels.

This table serves as the primary analytical layer for exploratory data analysis
and machine learning feature generation.

---

## Source Tables
- `dim_product`
- `fact_sales_international` (aggregated)
- `fact_sales_amazon` (aggregated)

---

## Grain
**One row per SKU**

Each record represents a single product SKU with summarized sales metrics
across multiple sales channels.

---

## Data Preparation Process

### 1. Aggregated Sales Metrics
Transactional fact tables were first aggregated to SKU level.

- International sales:
  - total units sold
  - total revenue
  - average selling price

- Amazon sales:
  - total units sold
  - total revenue
  - average selling price

---

### 2. Analytics Mart Creation
The aggregated sales metrics were joined with the product dimension to create
a single, analysis-ready dataset.

Only left joins were used to ensure full product coverage, even for SKUs that
did not sell in one or more channels.

## Output Table
- `finance.sku_analytics_mart`

## Table Schema
`finance.sku_analytics_mart`

Columns:
- `product_id` — surrogate product key
- `sku` — product SKU
- `design_no` — design identifier
- `category` — product category
- `size` — product size
- `color` — product color

- `intl_units_sold` — total international units sold
- `intl_revenue` — total international revenue
- `intl_avg_price` — average international selling price

- `amazon_units_sold` — total Amazon units sold
- `amazon_revenue` — total Amazon revenue
- `amazon_avg_price` — average Amazon selling price

---

## Data Validation
- Verified one-row-per-SKU grain
- Confirmed no duplicate SKUs
- Validated aggregated metrics against source fact tables
- Ensured null values correctly represent lack of sales in a channel

---

## Usage
This analytics mart is used to:
- Perform SKU-level exploratory data analysis
- Compare sales performance across channels
- Serve as the base dataset for machine learning feature engineering
- Support demand forecasting and SKU segmentation tasks

---

## Notes
Pricing data is intentionally excluded from this mart because SKU identifiers
in the pricing sources do not align with sales SKUs. Pricing analysis is therefore
performed independently to avoid invalid or misleading joins.

---

## Status
**Final and stable**
