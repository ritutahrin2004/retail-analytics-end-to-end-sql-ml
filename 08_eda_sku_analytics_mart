# SKU Analytics Mart — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a SKU-level analytics mart built using PostgreSQL and Python. The goal of this work is to validate data quality, understand sales behavior across channels, and establish a solid analytical foundation before moving into machine learning.

The focus of this project is correctness, reproducibility, and analytical discipline rather than premature modeling.

---

## Project Context

The analytics mart consolidates product attributes with aggregated sales performance across Amazon and International sales channels. Each row in the dataset represents a single SKU, combining static product information with channel-level sales metrics.

This EDA was conducted after rebuilding the full data pipeline from raw CSV imports to fact and dimension tables in PostgreSQL.

---

## Data Pipeline

The analytics mart is created under the `finance` schema in PostgreSQL using the following pipeline:

Raw Tables → Staging Tables → Fact Tables → Aggregations → SKU Analytics Mart

The final table used for analysis is:

finance.sku_analytics_mart

This table serves as the master dataset for both exploratory analysis and downstream machine learning.

## Notebook

The analysis is performed in the following notebook:

01_eda_sku_analytics_mart.ipynb

This notebook includes:
- Dataset validation and schema inspection
- Missing value analysis and handling of structural nulls
- Sales coverage analysis by channel
- Distribution analysis of units sold and revenue
- Long-tail revenue concentration analysis
- Category-level performance analysis
- Channel mix and cross-channel performance comparison
- A final EDA summary with modeling direction

EDA and machine learning are intentionally separated into different notebooks to maintain clarity and analytical rigor.

## Local CSV Dependency

The notebook loads the analytics mart from a locally exported CSV file:

df = pd.read_csv("E:/sku_analytics_mart.csv")

This design choice is intentional:
- All data modeling and transformations are handled in PostgreSQL
- The CSV represents a snapshot exported from the database
- The notebook focuses on analysis, not database connectivity

### Reproducing the Analysis

To reproduce the EDA:
1. Run the SQL scripts in this repository to create `finance.sku_analytics_mart`
2. Export the table to CSV from PostgreSQL
3. Either place the CSV at `E:/sku_analytics_mart.csv` or update the file path in the notebook to match your local environment

## Key EDA Findings

- The dataset contains 9,184 unique SKUs
- Approximately 80% of SKUs recorded sales in at least one channel
- Amazon has broader SKU coverage than international sales
- Sales and revenue distributions exhibit strong long-tail behavior
- A small percentage of SKUs drive the majority of revenue
- SKUs selling in both channels significantly outperform single-channel SKUs
- Category performance and channel mix vary meaningfully and should not be treated uniformly

---

## Modeling Direction

Based on the EDA results:
- The aggregated SKU-level dataset is well-suited for SKU segmentation (clustering)
- Classification tasks (e.g., predicting single-channel vs both-channel SKUs) are also viable
- Time-series demand forecasting is not appropriate given the current data grain

Machine learning will be implemented in a separate notebook using the validated insights from this EDA.

---

## Project Status

- Data warehouse rebuilt and validated
- SKU analytics mart recreated reproducibly
- Exploratory data analysis completed and documented
- Ready to proceed with machine learning

---

## Tech Stack

- PostgreSQL (schema design, transformations, aggregations)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control and documentation

This project prioritizes reproducibility, transparency, and sound analytical reasoning over shortcuts or surface-level results.
