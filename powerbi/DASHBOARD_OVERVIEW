# 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview  
**SKU Performance & Channel Segmentation**

This document explains how to read and interpret the Power BI executive dashboard provided in PDF format:

👉 [`powerbi/sku_performance_channel_segmentation_dashboard.pdf`](./powerbi/sku_performance_channel_segmentation_dashboard.pdf)

The dashboard is designed as a **single-page, decision-ready view** for understanding SKU performance across Amazon and International sales channels.

## 1. Top KPI Section

The top row provides an immediate portfolio-level summary:

- **Total Revenue** – Combined Amazon and International revenue across all SKUs
- **Total Units** – Total units sold across channels
- **% Cross-channel SKUs** – Share of SKUs selling in both Amazon and International channels
- **Active SKUs** – Total number of SKUs with at least one sale

These KPIs answer: *How large is the business, and how diversified is it across channels?*

---

## 2. SKU Distribution by Cluster

This chart shows the **count of SKUs** in each performance cluster:

- Amazon-focused SKUs  
- International-heavy SKUs  
- High-performing cross-channel SKUs  

It highlights how the SKU portfolio is structurally distributed across different performance segments.

---

## 3. Revenue Concentration by Cluster

This chart shows **total revenue contribution** by cluster.

Key takeaway:
- A smaller number of **high-performing cross-channel SKUs** contribute a disproportionate share of total revenue.

This visual reinforces the **Pareto effect** observed during EDA.

---

## 4. Channel Revenue by Cluster

This chart compares **Amazon vs International revenue** within each cluster.

It helps answer:
- Which clusters are Amazon-dependent?
- Which clusters are driven by International demand?
- Where cross-channel balance exists?

This is useful for channel expansion and prioritization decisions.

---

## 5. Category × Cluster Revenue Matrix

This matrix breaks down **revenue by product category and cluster**.

It is used to:
- Identify categories overrepresented in high-performing clusters
- Spot categories concentrated in low-impact SKUs

This supports **assortment rationalization and category strategy**.

---

## 6. SKU Action Table (Decision Layer)

The bottom table is the most actionable component of the dashboard.

For each SKU, it shows:
- Amazon revenue and units
- International revenue and units
- Total revenue and total units
- Cluster assignment
- **SKU Portfolio Tier (Top 20% vs Bottom 80%)**

### Top 20% Highlighting
SKUs in the **Top 20% revenue tier** are highlighted in green to clearly identify:
- Primary revenue drivers
- SKUs that should be prioritized for inventory, pricing, and expansion

This table is designed for **direct operational decision-making**, not exploration.

---

## 7. Filters & Interactivity

Available slicers:
- **Category**
- **Cluster label**

These allow focused analysis without altering the global portfolio logic (e.g., Top 20% classification remains stable).

---

## Final Note

This dashboard is intentionally:
- Single-page
- Aggregated at SKU level
- Focused on decisions rather than trends

It complements the deeper analysis documented in:
- `EXECUTIVE_STORY.md`
- Python EDA and ML notebooks
